## Summary  
This investigation focused on determining whether a **suspicious "digital creator" account** on Facebook and Instagram was a **bot, impersonator, or a real person**. The goal was to verify identity authenticity and understand whether a **real identity was being misused** or **purposefully operating behind layered personas.**

### Key Findings:
- The *suspicious account* was created in **October 2020**, but remained dormant until **February 2024**, one month after a **legitimate Facebook profile with the same name and photos went dormant** on **January 1, 2024**.
- Both profiles share the **same face**, but different behavior: the old one had family content, the new one claims to be a **Digitial Creator** and uses political bait engagement (e.g. using Trump imagery in banners).
- Reverse image searches showed the photos appearing on **escort directories** such as **RubPage** and **Xlamma**, suggesting either identity misuse or dual identity.
- Despite claiming to be a **licensed massage therapist in Edmond, OK**, no active or expired licenses under known aliases were found in state records.
- Instagram handle contained “1291” – consistent with a **December 1991 birthdate**, aligning with previous data pulled from various sources.
- Multiple “friends” and “followers” from **randomized states and countries such as Ohio, Pakistan, England, Iowa**, many with **suspicious or fake profiles**, common in **engagement farming and bot net activity**.
- Personal outreach to mutual friends confirmed **random adds** and no real-world connection to the account owner.

## Skills Demonstrated

### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- **Cross-platform correlation** of identities, timelines, and metadata.
- **Visual recognition and traceability** via reverse image search engines (Pimeyes, Yandex).
- **Metadata and behavior analysis** to compare social signals between real and fake accounts.
- **Manual verification** through direct communication and licensing authorities.

### Digital Threat Attribution
- Created an **identity timeline** to spot behavioral shifts and match them to platform activity.
- Assessed the **likelihood of bot behavior vs. dual identity management**, useful in both CTI and fraud environments.

### Threat Intelligence Readiness
- Demonstrated professional curiosity and ethical intent throughout.
- Simulated a **real-world threat triage and analysis cycle**, common in CTI roles.
- Willing to **pivot tools and techniques** as new information became available.

- **Identify identity fraud and impersonation** across platforms.
- **Assess the digital footprint** and uncover signs of deception or multi-use identity.
- Contribute to **Threat Intel or Fraud Investigation teams** needing someone who can **map adversarial behavior**, correlate it to known trends, and report findings clearly.
